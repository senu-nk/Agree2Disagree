# Agree2Disagree

This is a very small demonstration project showing a minimal Flask
application where visitors can agree or disagree with a statement.

## Running the app

1. Create a virtual environment (optional)::

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies::

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the server::

   python app.py

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

You can click **Agree** or **Disagree** for the example statement and view
the running totals.
